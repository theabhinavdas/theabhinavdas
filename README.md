:wave: Hello, world. I'm Abhinav and I love solving problems with tech. I hail from Hyderabad, a city in India famous for its [biryani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani).

I have 14 years of experience with breaking and building things. For 8 years now, I've been a manager of managers however I am super hands-on with technology.

In my current org, I serve as the Head of Engineering/CTO at a leading [Venture Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_studio). Here, I am mainly involved with:
1. getting high-quality stuff done on time
2. bringing great people into the organization
3. getting someone to replace what I do so I can go do other things

Previously, I worked as the Head of Engineering for [Talent Inc.](https://talentinc.com), a tech-enabled career services business. Here, my team and I built popular internet brands like [resume.io](https://resume.io), [career.io](https://career.io), [topresume.com](https://topresume.com), and [topcv.com](https://topcv.com). At Talent, I grew the engineering function from ~15 to >60 people. I was also actively involved with coaching and mentoring my people.

Thus far, across my career, I helped take one company public, built numerous 0-1 products, been part of founding teams of two web3 companies that raised more than $25M through ICOs.

Outside of work, I'm a "traveling foodie" :tm:. _4 countries_ and counting! I care very deeply about music. Especially classical music. Don't worry, I'm not a snob. I currently actively learn the violin and the [_tabla_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) in their respective Hindustani classical styles.

I like meeting new people and learning new things. So feel free to reach out on my socials:
